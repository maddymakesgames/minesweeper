# Minesweeper

This minesweeper game was programmed in a bit under a week using nothing but pure html and js.
The game board and all the options are rendered using a html5 canvas.
There are definitely performance improvements I could make in terms of not drawing somethings again that don't need to be drawn, but I haven't had performance issues while testing so they aren't a huge priority for me.
There are no comments because the function and variable names were enough for me while making this. So have fun trying to figure out some of the math. I positioned menu items just by trying different values and seeing how it looked, so I don't really understand most of the math myself.

This project originally started out as something simple so I could figure out the logic to make minesweeper for the ti-84 but quickly became bigger than I thought.

There is sometimes a rendering issue on page load, I don’t know what causes it or how to fix it but resizing the window or clicking on the game board fixes it. Its probably trying to render something slightly too early or something, I don’t really know.

All assets made by me using gimp, if you want to use them for some reason go ahead.
